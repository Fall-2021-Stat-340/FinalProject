## Abstract
An abstract of at most 300 words giving an overview of your data, the question(s) you tried to
answer, and a brief summary of your findings.


## Dataset
*A brief introduction describing your data set: where it came from, who gathered it and a brief
description of why your group found this data interesting and why your reader should care. If you
obtained your data set from Kaggle or a similar repository, it is not enough to simply say “This was
collected by user xyz and posted to Kaggle”. You should be able to explain the specific source of your data.*

Our analysis used the World Development Indicators dataset. We accessed the dataset from Kaggle where it was published directly by Kaggle. It includes two files. The first is Country.csv, which includes a row for each of the 247 countries present in the dataset, along with the country's name, code, currency, and region. The second file, Indicators.csv, contains a comprehensive list of over 1,300 indicators related to economic development, health, and more. Some of these indicators include GDP per capita, unemployment rate, adolescent fertility rate, and urban population. Indicators for years between 1960 and 2015 are present, although not every combination of country, indicator, and year is available. More than 70% of the total data is missing, so careful consideration will be taken when choosing what countries, indicators, and years to analyze.

The data was compiled by the World Bank, an international financial organization that provides support for lower-income countries. They track the indicators found in this dataset and compile them for anayone to use. Our group was drawn to this dataset because of its importance and relevance. The indicators included comprise some of the most discussed and debated inequalities between countries. While we cannot solve these inequalities just by looking at data, we are excited to investigate and identify prominent relationships between features.


## Variables
A description of the variables available in your data set, with more details for the variables that are
likely to be relevant to your question (you may copy-paste this from your previous drafts, if you
wish).


## Statistical Questions
A discussion of your statistical question of interest.


## Analysis
A summary, including as many plots, tables, R model outputs, etc as necessary to show how you
tried to answer your statistical question. You should explain the reasoning behind your decisions to
use particular methods, models or tests. This summary need not include only successes– if you tried
something that turned out not to work, take some time to discuss it, why it might not have worked,
and how your might fix the problem given more time.


## Conclusion
A brief summary of your findings and potential future research questions
