## Dataset

URL: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/world-development-indicators

This dataset is a collection of some of the indicators of economic development the World bank collects. We think this dataset is good because it is a rich dataset so there would be plenty of interesting patterns to find. Also, the conclusions will be grounded in measures of economic development (i.e. "Adolescent fertility rate negatively correlates with GDP"). Since the dataset is so rich we could find both simple and complex patterns (to use more advanced techniques).

## Statistical Questions

1. What interesting or strong correlations between variables are there?
2. What kinds of claims can we make from this data? How can we confirm them?

## Variables

This dataset has 118 columns for each country (so ~200 rows). There are a lot of interesting colums such as:

- SystemOfNationalAccounts (economic activity)
- Adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15-19)
- Age dependency ratio (% of working-age population)
- Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)
- CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)

It's hard to choose what variables we think are the most important right now because we are unsure what the most significant indicators are of economic growth, success, or stability. However, we feel confident that these inicators *will* result in interesting patterns that will be more than sufficient to do analysis on.

## Methods

- We want to use Monte Carlo simulation to verify
- Clustering
- Regression
